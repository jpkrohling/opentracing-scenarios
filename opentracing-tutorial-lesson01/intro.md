OpenTracing is a vendor neutral specification for instrumentation APIs.

It offers consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral APIs for popular platforms, making it easy for developers to add (or switch) tracing implementations with an O(1) configuration change. OpenTracing also offers a lingua franca for OSS instrumentation and platform-specific tracing helper libraries.
