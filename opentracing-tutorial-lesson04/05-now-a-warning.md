Of course, while baggage is an extermely powerful mechanism, it is also dangerous. If we store a 1Mb value/string in baggage, every request in the call graph below that point will have to carry that 1Mb of data. So baggage must be used with caution. In fact, Jaeger client libraries implement centrally controlled baggage restrictions, so that only blessed services can put blessed keys in the baggage, with possible restrictions on the value length.
