In Lesson 3 we have seen how span context is propagated over the wire between different applications. It is not hard to see that this process can be generalized to propagating more than just the tracing context. With OpenTracing instrumentation in place, we can support general purpose _distributed context propagation_ where we associate some metadata with the transaction and make that metadata available anywhere in the distributed call graph. In OpenTracing this metadata is called _baggage_, to highlight the fact that it is carried over in-band with all RPC requests, just like baggage.

We'll start this lesson where we stopped in lesson 3.

The `formatter` service takes the `helloTo` parameter and returns a string `Hello, {helloTo}!`. Let's modify it so that we can customize the greeting too, but without modifying the public API of that service.
