We will be using an open source distributed tracing system Jaeger to collect and view the traces and analyze the application behavior. Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies.

##Â Task

To launch Jaeger, start the Docker container demo.

`docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -p 5775:5775/udp -p 16686:16686 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest`{{execute}}

Port _5775_ is used for collecting metrics, while _16686_ is used for accessing the Jaeger dashboard.
